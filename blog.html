                    1. What is the difference between Local Storage and Session Storage?
                </div>

                <div class="collapse-content text-zinc-500">
                    <p>The main difference between Local Storage and Session Storage is data in localStorage doesn't
                        expire whereas data in session Storage is cleared when the page closed.That's mean localStorage
                        stored data permanently and session Storage stored temporary. The storage capacity of local
                        storage is 5MB/10MB and The storage capacity of local storage is 5MB.</p>

                    2. What is the difference between Global Scope and Block Scope?
                </div>

                <div class="collapse-content text-zinc-500">
                    <p> scope means which variable is accessible and upto which point it is accessible. As the name says
                        'Global' means universal.So, in javascript
                        the whole document is global scope and all the other functions and variables are contained in
                        this global scope.On the other hand,
                        A variable when declared inside the if or switch conditions or inside for or
                        while loops, are accessible within that particular condition or loop are called as within block
                        scope.As the name says 'Block' means barrier so, it works like e barrier for a the variables
                        which declared inside the curly brackets. </p>

                    3. How does the Event Loop works in JavaScript?
                </div>

                <div class="collapse-content text-zinc-500">
                    <p> The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear before pushing callbacks
                        from the Task Queue to the Call Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event loop triggers and
                        checks the Task Queue for available callbacks. If there are any, it pushes it to the Call Stack,
                        waits for the Call Stack to be clear again, and repeats the same process.</p>
